# About Me

I’m John Rioflorido.—a design integrator, accessibility advocate, and ethical AI strategist who lives at the intersection of systems thinking and moral clarity.
My work is driven by a simple but radical belief: people with disabilities are first-class citizens, and technology should reflect that truth. I build tools, frameworks, and experiences that translate abstract principles—like fairness, transparency, and inclusion—into usable systems that serve real people.

I’ve spent my career navigating the terrain between design and development, cartography and accessibility, research and application. That breadth allows me to surface blind spots others miss, challenge vague reasoning, and propose solutions that are both principled and pragmatic. I’m known for disruptive clarity, but I lead with openness—I’ll always listen, and I’ll always give you the way to change my mind.
My most formative experiences have taught me that coherence between self and work isn’t just possible—it’s powerful.

Whether I’m scaling accessibility efforts across an organization or contributing to open-source projects that advance ethical AI, I bring my full self to the table: principled, accountable, and relentlessly focused on impact.

If you’re building toward inclusive outcomes, ethical defaults, or systems that respect human dignity—I’d love to be part of that conversation.

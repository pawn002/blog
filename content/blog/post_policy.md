In launching this blog-portfolio hybrid, I aim to create a space where thoughtful discourse and practical insights on corporate communications can flourish. The ethical stance that guides this platform, rooted in pragmatic consequentialism, informs how I curate, update, and present content. Below is the revised policy that reflects this ethical framework alongside the latest guidance:

1. Outcomes Matter
Content on this blog will be developed and updated with a primary focus on outcomes. Each post aims not only to share information but to foster understanding, provoke thought, and stimulate constructive action. I will assess the implications of my posts, considering how they can serve the interests of my audience and the broader community.
2. Epistemic Humility
Recognizing the complexities of qualitative value, I commit to maintaining epistemic humility. I acknowledge that measuring value can be subjective and nuanced, and I will strive to present information that reflects this complexity. Feedback from my audience will be welcomed and considered to enhance the quality and relevance of the content.
3. Negotiated Social Contracts
I treat formal ethical frameworks as negotiated social contracts rather than absolute constraints. This means that the ethical guidelines I follow will be subject to adaptation based on context and community standards. Ongoing dialogue with readers will be essential to reassess these frameworks and ensure they align with collective priorities and values.
4. Personal Moral Discretion
In instances where external ethical standards diverge from my priorities, I reserve the right to exercise personal moral discretion. This allows me to stay true to my principles while adapting content to remain relevant and impactful. Significant changes to content arising from this discretion will be communicated transparently to maintain trust with my audience.
5. Content Updates for Current Relevancy
Each post will be updated to ensure current relevance. An "edited" or "updated" caveat will be included prominently in the post rather than modifying the initial post date. To further clarify, these caveat dates will include specific timestamps to differentiate the original post date from the last update date.
6. Reader Empowerment and Feedback
Readers interested in previous iterations of a post will have access to my contact information to reach out. They are encouraged to provide feedback on revisions to the posts or this policy, and I will strive to address all input thoughtfully.
7. Third-Party Audits
As time permits, I may reach out to peers to act as third-party auditors for this policy and the responses to feedback. Their insights will help ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the content and its updates.
8. Dedicated Policy Post
This policy, along with any future iterations or updates, will be presented as its own distinct post, allowing easy access for reference and discussion.
9. Engagement and Responsibility
Reader engagement is vital to this platform. I encourage discussion, questions, and critiques to foster a rich dialogue that can lead to better outcomes. I am committed to responding to comments and maintaining a respectful environment for discourse.

## Conclusion

This blog-portfolio hybrid exemplifies my commitment to ethical content creation. By prioritizing meaningful outcomes, embracing humility, and being open to negotiation, I aim to contribute positively to conversations around corporate communications while remaining responsive to the needs and values of my audience. This policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure it stays aligned with evolving ethical standards and community expectations. Thank you for being part of this journey!

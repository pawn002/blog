## Executive Summary

Leading as an Ethical Systems Designer and modeling Applied Philosophy in Design, I cultivate an ethic that focuses on outcomes while remaining humble on measuring qualitative value. This approach enables me to build and lead cross-disciplinary teams that turn accessible, ethically-grounded design and systems thinking into faster iteration, and safer products. Along the way, I provide decision infrastructure that lets decision makers quickly make defensible trade-offs while also multiplying organizational talent so organizations can retain cross-functional practitioners that ship responsibly without slowing innovation.

## Ethical Systems Design

Ethical systems design is like most design, in that you are producing some artifact within a body of constraints guided by requirements.

While traditional design disciplines work with tangible primitives like color, shape, or material, ethical systems design operates with more abstract primitives: values, judgments, and nuanced ethical frameworks that shape decision-making infrastructures.

Bridging between traditional and ethical systems designers, both have a sensibility or taste in how they use design primitives to create a design. Whereas a traditional designer can be said to have a distinctive artistic style, an ethical systems designer has an ethical stance that informs their creations.

## My Ethical Stance

I am a pragmatic consequentialist who prioritizes outcomes while preserving intellectual modesty about measuring qualitative value. I treat formal ethical frameworks as negotiated social contracts rather than absolute constraints and recognize individuals may have to exercise personal moral discretion when those contracts diverge from their priorities.

### Core Commitments

• Outcome orientation: Consequences determine moral weight.
• Practical agreement-based approach: I rely on agreed frameworks with peers as defaults for coordination.
• Relational adjustment: I prefer to renegotiate or partner with affected parties when deviating from promises or rules.
• Agency respect: I give stakeholders the power to accept or reject policy choices that affect them.
• Moral pluralism: I accept that personal morality may diverge from collective ethics and that both have roles.

## Practical Strengths

My ethical stance:

• Maximizes responsiveness to real harms and benefits.
• Encourages transparent negotiation with stakeholders rather than stealthy rule-breaking.
• Reduces rigid absolutism, enabling flexible solutions across complex, contested cases.
• Centers consent and agency when implementing consequential trade-offs.

## Key Risks and Vulnerabilities

• Potential for selective exception-making where personal priorities justify disproportionate deviations.
• Reliance on partner consent can be coercive if power imbalances exist or choices are constrained.
• Difficulty aggregating qualitative goods may produce inconsistency across similar cases.
• Erosion of Institutional trust if negotiated exceptions become routine rather than exceptional.

## Norms and Safeguards That Align With My Ethical Stance

• Implement clear, participatory procedures for renegotiating obligations with affected parties.
• Require transparency and documentation when promises or rules are modified for consequential reasons.
• Build independent review or arbitration for cases where power imbalances could distort consent.
• Use iterative, evidence-based evaluation to learn how qualitative outcomes actually track with decisions.

## Wrapping Up

My approach to ethical systems design is not a fixed destination but an ongoing journey of critical reflection and adaptive learning. Ethical leadership demands continuous recalibration - a dynamic process of understanding complex human systems while remaining committed to core principles of harm reduction, stakeholder empowerment, and principled flexibility.

The measure of an ethical framework is not its theoretical perfection, but its capacity to:

• Respond meaningfully to emerging challenges
• Preserve human agency and dignity
• Create sustainable and just outcomes across diverse contexts
• Remain open to critique and refinement

As technological and social landscapes rapidly transform, ethical systems design must embrace intellectual modesty as its most powerful tool. This means cultivating:

• Persistent curiosity about unintended consequences
• Genuine openness to perspectives beyond our immediate understanding
• Systematic mechanisms for ongoing evaluation and course correction

Ultimately, my ethical stance is less about achieving moral absolutism and more about creating adaptive, resilient decision infrastructures that can navigate complexity with integrity, empathy, and pragmatic wisdom.

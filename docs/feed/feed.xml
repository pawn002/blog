    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome the blog!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is very much under construction, so this post is a shortie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of upheaval across diverse domains right now. I find spaces like this present a rich opportunity space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to say on upheaval and opportunuity, but I have a blog site to build out. ðŸ˜‰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please stay tuned for writing that touches on opportunity and many other subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you in the next post(s)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pawn002/whisper-electron-app&quot;&gt;Whisper Transcription App&lt;/a&gt;—a free, open-source offline transcription tool—using responsible AI practices and accessibility-first product architecture to address privacy concerns in AI-powered transcription. By leveraging domain expertise in inclusive design, WCAG compliance, and product strategy, I collaborated with Claude Code to deliver a cross-platform solution that bridges the technical divide between powerful CLI tools and everyday users. This project demonstrates how trustworthy AI architecture and systems integration can democratize software development while preserving user privacy and ethical defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-privacy-paradox&quot;&gt;The Privacy Paradox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been navigating an uncomfortable tension lately: wanting the convenience of AI-powered transcription while being deeply uncomfortable shipping sensitive conversations to cloud servers I don&#39;t control. Privacy is a big deal, especially with privacy concerns pertaining to the cloud and data being uploaded to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tension led me to build something I&#39;m calling the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pawn002/whisper-electron-app&quot;&gt;Whisper Transcription App&lt;/a&gt;—a standalone offline transcription tool that makes OpenAI&#39;s powerful Whisper.cpp accessible to non-technical users. The ironic twist? I built it using responsible AI practices to preserve our privacy from AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://pawn002.github.io/blog/img/mnHB-acxH9-400.avif 400w, https://pawn002.github.io/blog/img/mnHB-acxH9-800.avif 800w, https://pawn002.github.io/blog/img/mnHB-acxH9-1279.avif 1279w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://pawn002.github.io/blog/img/mnHB-acxH9-400.webp 400w, https://pawn002.github.io/blog/img/mnHB-acxH9-800.webp 800w, https://pawn002.github.io/blog/img/mnHB-acxH9-1279.webp 1279w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pawn002.github.io/blog/blog/building-whisper-transcription-app/content/img/mnHB-acxH9-400.png&quot; alt=&quot;Whisper Transcription App interface&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;1279&quot; height=&quot;763&quot; srcset=&quot;https://pawn002.github.io/blog/img/mnHB-acxH9-400.png 400w, https://pawn002.github.io/blog/img/mnHB-acxH9-800.png 800w, https://pawn002.github.io/blog/img/mnHB-acxH9-1279.png 1279w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better: I used the app to transcribe the interview that became the basis for this post. That delightfully meta moment underscored just how functional this MVP already is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;recognizing-the-real-problem&quot;&gt;Recognizing the Real Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insight here isn&#39;t about breakthrough technology—&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp&quot;&gt;Whisper.cpp&lt;/a&gt; has been available for some time and offers exceptional transcription accuracy comparable to cloud-based solutions. The problem is accessibility. Whisper.cpp has been locked away behind command-line interfaces that intimidate most users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks are used to an experience where you&#39;re able to use some type of interface to upload files, transcribe things, and then do various actions like view history. Whisper.cpp does not allow you to do that as a default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of blind spot my career has trained me to surface. The technical divide between powerful open-source tools and everyday users isn&#39;t just frustrating—it&#39;s a barrier to privacy-preserving alternatives gaining adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bridging-technical-barriers-with-domain-expertise&quot;&gt;Bridging Technical Barriers with Domain Expertise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical challenges were significant. Whisper.cpp has its quirks—it requires 16-bit wave files, a detail that can derail non-technical users. My app automates this conversion process using &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffmpeg.org/&quot;&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/a&gt;, accepting any audio file type and handling the technical heavy lifting invisibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built on &lt;a href=&quot;https://material.angular.io/components&quot;&gt;Angular Material&lt;/a&gt; for now (though I&#39;m open to exploring other UI libraries), the interface embraces established patterns that users already understand. As an accessibility consultant, I paid special attention to keyboard navigation (WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard) and screen reader compatibility (WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value), even going beyond Angular Material&#39;s solid baseline to remediate contrast issues for users with low vision (WCAG 1.4.3 Contrast Minimum, 1.4.6 Contrast Enhanced).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s what makes this story worth telling: I&#39;m primarily an accessibility expert with frontend and a little bit of backend work experience. I lacked the Electron and C++ knowledge typically required for such a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.ai/&quot;&gt;Claude Code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-democratization-of-development&quot;&gt;The Democratization of Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in the age of AI, and because of this, we have powerful tools like Claude Code that enable me to basically one-shot these apps. But let me be clear—this wasn&#39;t a single prompt miracle. Instead, I leveraged my expertise in product strategy, design, UX/UI, and accessibility to guide the AI through iterative development, fast-tracking past potential issues I spotted during the build process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This represents something I&#39;ve been watching unfold across the industry: technical barriers that once required years of specialized training can now be overcome through intelligent collaboration between domain experts and AI assistants. I became a software architect not by learning C++, but by knowing what users need and how to guide an AI to build it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That coherence between self and work—between my accessibility expertise and the development process—isn&#39;t just possible. It&#39;s powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;free-as-in-freedom&quot;&gt;Free as in Freedom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an era of subscription fatigue, where every AI tool seems to demand monthly tribute, this app takes a radically different approach: it&#39;s completely free and open source. The entire codebase lives on GitHub, available for anyone to examine, modify, or build upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is that with the availability of the app on GitHub, it shows how you can actually create your own implementation of a Whisper app for local offline transcription. This isn&#39;t just about providing a tool; it&#39;s about teaching through transparency, showing other developers how to build privacy-preserving alternatives to cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows—true cross-platform availability. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pawn002/whisper-electron-app/tree/main#-quick-start&quot;&gt;Getting started&lt;/a&gt; is surprisingly straightforward. Users need only a fairly modern recent laptop to achieve impressive speeds—about 10 seconds to transcribe one minute of audio using the base model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-road-ahead&quot;&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current release is admittedly an MVP, but the roadmap reveals ambitious thinking about privacy-preserving AI infrastructure. Real-time transcription and speaker diarization are on the horizon, but the most intriguing vision involves Anthropic&#39;s Model Context Protocol (MCP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By deliberately architecting the app with separate backend and frontend components, I&#39;m positioning it to become a privacy-preserving transcription layer that could integrate with various AI chat services. Imagine Claude or ChatGPT gaining transcription capabilities without your audio ever leaving your machine—that&#39;s the future I&#39;m building here as a trustworthy AI architect. For technical details on how this architecture enables these capabilities, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pawn002/whisper-electron-app/blob/main/docs/architecture.md&quot;&gt;architecture documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lessons-learned-trade-offs-and-design-decisions&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned: Trade-offs and Design Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building this tool surfaced several critical trade-offs that shaped the final product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Processing vs. User Experience Friction&lt;/strong&gt;
The decision to keep everything offline meant accepting slower transcription speeds and requiring users to download model files. A cloud-based solution would be faster and more seamless, but would fundamentally undermine the privacy promise. I prioritized alignment with core values over convenience—users who care about privacy will accept the trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MVP Scope vs. Feature Completeness&lt;/strong&gt;
I deliberately shipped without real-time transcription and speaker diarization, features that many competitors offer. This wasn&#39;t a capability gap—it was a strategic choice to validate the core value proposition first: does offline transcription with a usable interface actually solve the problem? Shipping the MVP quickly let me test that hypothesis rather than building features that might not matter if the foundation was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UI Framework Selection: Familiar vs. Optimal&lt;/strong&gt;
Choosing Angular Material was pragmatic rather than perfect. While other frameworks might offer better performance or smaller bundle sizes, Angular Material provided established patterns, solid accessibility baselines, and faster development velocity when working with Claude Code. For an MVP proving a concept, &amp;quot;good enough and fast&amp;quot; beat &amp;quot;theoretically optimal but slower.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Source Transparency vs. Competitive Advantage&lt;/strong&gt;
Making the entire codebase public means anyone can fork it, rebrand it, or build a commercial competitor. That&#39;s intentional. The goal isn&#39;t market dominance—it&#39;s mission alignment: demonstrating that privacy-preserving tools are buildable and that AI can democratize development. If someone builds on this work to create something better, that validates the mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Debt from AI-Assisted Development&lt;/strong&gt;
Collaborating with Claude Code accelerated development but created architectural decisions I might revisit. Some abstractions reflect AI suggestions rather than my own design preferences. The trade-off: ship in weeks instead of months, but accept that refactoring may be needed as the project matures. For an MVP, time-to-validation justified the technical debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-this-matters&quot;&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project represents something larger than just another transcription tool. It&#39;s a proof point for multiple converging trends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The democratization of software development through AI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The growing demand for privacy-preserving alternatives to cloud services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The power of open-source solutions to fill gaps left by commercial offerings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value of bringing domain expertise to technical challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In using AI to build tools that protect us from AI&#39;s privacy implications, I&#39;ve created something beautifully recursive—a privacy-preserving transcription tool built by AI, for humans who want to keep their data away from AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also a demonstration of a principle I&#39;ve held throughout my career: that breadth allows me to surface blind spots others miss and propose solutions that are both principled and pragmatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-involved&quot;&gt;Get Involved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Whisper Transcription App is available now on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pawn002/whisper-electron-app&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. While building the app requires some technical knowledge, anyone should be able to run it in dev mode with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pawn002/whisper-electron-app/tree/main/docs&quot;&gt;robust documentation provided&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an age where every innovation seems to come with strings attached, here&#39;s one that&#39;s genuinely free—in every sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re building toward inclusive outcomes, ethical defaults, or systems that respect human dignity—I&#39;d love to hear from you. This is exactly the kind of conversation I want to be part of.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My Ethical Stance as an Ethical Systems Designer</title>
    <link href="https://pawn002.github.io/blog/blog/my_ethical_stance/" />
    <updated>2025-10-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://pawn002.github.io/blog/blog/my_ethical_stance/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT: Before proceeding, please be sure to read this post&#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://pawn002.github.io/blog/blog/legal_disclaimer/&quot;&gt;Legal Disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://pawn002.github.io/blog/blog/organizational_disclaimer&quot;&gt;Organizational Disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading as an Ethical Systems Designer and modeling Applied Philosophy in Design, I cultivate an ethic that focuses on outcomes while remaining humble on measuring qualitative value. This approach enables me to build and lead cross-disciplinary teams that turn accessible, ethically-grounded design and systems thinking into faster iteration, and safer products. Along the way, I provide decision infrastructure that lets decision makers quickly make defensible trade-offs while also multiplying organizational talent so organizations can retain cross-functional practitioners that ship responsibly without slowing innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ethical-systems-design&quot;&gt;Ethical Systems Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethical systems design is like most design, in that you are producing some artifact within a body of constraints guided by requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While traditional design disciplines work with tangible primitives like color, shape, or material, ethical systems design operates with more abstract primitives: values, judgments, and nuanced ethical frameworks that shape decision-making infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridging between traditional and ethical systems designers, both have a sensibility or taste in how they use design primitives to create a design. Whereas a traditional designer can be said to have a distinctive artistic style, an ethical systems designer has an ethical stance that informs their creations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-ethical-stance&quot;&gt;My Ethical Stance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a pragmatic consequentialist who prioritizes outcomes while preserving intellectual modesty about measuring qualitative value. I treat formal ethical frameworks as negotiated social contracts rather than absolute constraints and recognize individuals may have to exercise personal moral discretion when those contracts diverge from their priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;core-commitments&quot;&gt;Core Commitments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outcome orientation: Consequences determine moral weight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practical agreement-based approach: I rely on agreed frameworks with peers as defaults for coordination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relational adjustment: I prefer to renegotiate or partner with affected parties when deviating from promises or rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agency respect: I give stakeholders the power to accept or reject policy choices that affect them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moral pluralism: I accept that personal morality may diverge from collective ethics and that both have roles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;practical-strengths&quot;&gt;Practical Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ethical stance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximizes responsiveness to real harms and benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourages transparent negotiation with stakeholders rather than stealthy rule-breaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduces rigid absolutism, enabling flexible solutions across complex, contested cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centers consent and agency when implementing consequential trade-offs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-risks-and-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;Key Risks and Vulnerabilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential for selective exception-making where personal priorities justify disproportionate deviations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliance on partner consent can be coercive if power imbalances exist or choices are constrained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difficulty aggregating qualitative goods may produce inconsistency across similar cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erosion of Institutional trust if negotiated exceptions become routine rather than exceptional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;norms-and-safeguards-that-align-with-my-ethical-stance&quot;&gt;Norms and Safeguards That Align With My Ethical Stance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement clear, participatory procedures for renegotiating obligations with affected parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Require transparency and documentation when promises or rules are modified for consequential reasons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build independent review or arbitration for cases where power imbalances could distort consent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use iterative, evidence-based evaluation to learn how qualitative outcomes actually track with decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My approach to ethical systems design is not a fixed destination but an ongoing journey of critical reflection and adaptive learning. Ethical leadership demands continuous recalibration - a dynamic process of understanding complex human systems while remaining committed to core principles of harm reduction, stakeholder empowerment, and principled flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure of an ethical framework is not its theoretical perfection, but its capacity to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respond meaningfully to emerging challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve human agency and dignity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create sustainable and just outcomes across diverse contexts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remain open to critique and refinement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As technological and social landscapes rapidly transform, ethical systems design must embrace intellectual modesty as its most powerful tool. This means cultivating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent curiosity about unintended consequences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genuine openness to perspectives beyond our immediate understanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systematic mechanisms for ongoing evaluation and course correction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, my ethical stance is less about achieving moral absolutism and more about creating adaptive, resilient decision infrastructures that can navigate complexity with integrity, empathy, and pragmatic wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blog Post Policy</title>
    <link href="https://pawn002.github.io/blog/blog/post_policy/" />
    <updated>2025-10-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://pawn002.github.io/blog/blog/post_policy/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated: 21 October 2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In launching this blog-portfolio hybrid, I aim to create a space where thoughtful discourse and practical insights on corporate communications can flourish. The ethical stance that guides this platform, rooted in pragmatic consequentialism, informs how I curate, update, and present content. Below is the revised policy that reflects this ethical framework alongside the latest guidance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-outcomes-matter&quot;&gt;1. Outcomes Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content on this blog will be developed and updated with a primary focus on outcomes. Each post aims not only to share information but to foster understanding, provoke thought, and stimulate constructive action. I will assess the implications of my posts, considering how they can serve the interests of my audience and the broader community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-intellectual-modesty&quot;&gt;2. Intellectual Modesty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the complexities of qualitative value, I commit to maintaining intellectual modesty. I acknowledge that measuring value can be subjective and nuanced, and I will strive to present information that reflects this complexity. Feedback from my audience will be welcomed and considered to enhance the quality and relevance of the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-negotiated-social-contracts&quot;&gt;3. Negotiated Social Contracts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I treat formal ethical frameworks as negotiated social contracts rather than absolute constraints. This means that the ethical guidelines I follow will be subject to adaptation based on context and community standards. Ongoing dialogue with readers will be essential to reassess these frameworks and ensure they align with collective priorities and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-content-updates-for-current-relevancy&quot;&gt;4. Content Updates for Current Relevancy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each post will be updated to ensure current relevance. An &amp;quot;edited&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;updated&amp;quot; caveat will be included prominently in the post rather than modifying the initial post date. To further clarify, these caveat dates will include specific timestamps to differentiate the original post date from the last update date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-reader-empowerment-and-feedback&quot;&gt;5. Reader Empowerment and Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers interested in previous iterations of a post will have access to my contact information to reach out. They are encouraged to provide feedback on revisions to the posts or this policy, and I will strive to address all input thoughtfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-third-party-audits&quot;&gt;6. Third-Party Audits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time permits, I may reach out to peers to act as third-party auditors for this policy and the responses to feedback. Their insights will help ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the content and its updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-dedicated-policy-post&quot;&gt;7. Dedicated Policy Post&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This policy, along with any future iterations or updates, will be presented as its own distinct post, allowing easy access for reference and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-engagement-and-responsibility&quot;&gt;8. Engagement and Responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reader engagement is vital to this platform. I encourage discussion, questions, and critiques to foster a rich dialogue that can lead to better outcomes. I am committed to responding to comments and maintaining a respectful environment for discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog-portfolio hybrid exemplifies my commitment to ethical content creation. By prioritizing meaningful outcomes, embracing humility, and being open to negotiation, I aim to contribute positively to conversations around corporate communications while remaining responsive to the needs and values of my audience. This policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure it stays aligned with evolving ethical standards and community expectations. Thank you for being part of this journey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site is very much under construction, so this post is a shortie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of upheaval across diverse domains right now. I find spaces like this present a rich opportunity space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to say on upheaval and opportunuity, but I have a blog site to build out. 😉&lt;/p&gt;

## Notes

- Intended to use this to announce blog post to coincide with 24 November 2025 publication but risk assessment flagged possibility that doing so would signal to interested parties I was looking for another job.
- Relook and likely update this announcement in the future if the above risk changes or is OBE.

**New Case Study: How Product Thinking Transformed a Workflow Problem into a Government-Wide Accessibility Tool**

In 2014, accessibility requirements broke my design workflow. Instead of accepting the friction, I applied product development fundamentals to build Contrast Chaser—a tool currently used across multiple government agencies to enable accessible visual design at production scale.

The case study documents the journey from MVP to product, highlighting:

✅ Problem identification that framed the right challenge
✅ User research that distinguished assumptions from validated needs
✅ Prototyping to test specific hypotheses (not to ship)
✅ Strategic foresight that enabled rapid deployment when browser APIs caught up
✅ Product lifecycle principles applied in a government context

**Key insight:** Product thinking isn't just for commercial markets. The same fundamentals—systematic problem identification, user research, hypothesis-driven prototyping, and iterative development—apply whether you're building for revenue or mission impact.

The full case study covers:
• How WCAG compliance requirements created workflow friction
• Three research prototypes that validated the product direction
• The gap between identified solutions and technical feasibility
• Leading a team with autonomous product management authority

For accessibility officers, design directors, and product leaders working at the intersection of inclusive design and systems integration: this is the kind of work I bring to high-accountability problems.

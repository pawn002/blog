### Target users to center when treating your portfolio like a product

Below is a focused set of user types you should design for. For each I include their primary goal, a measurable success metric, and one concrete design implication you can act on.

| **User** | **Primary goal** | **Success metric** | **Design implication** | **Priority** |
|---|---|---:|---|---:|
| Hiring manager in Ethical AI | Quickly assess fit for a senior product role | Time to verdict under 3 minutes | Lead with 2–3 portfolio stories that map to mission, measurable impact, and governance outcomes | High |
| Technical hiring manager or engineering lead | Validate technical competence and collaboration | Confidence to invite for technical interview | Include code links, architecture diagrams, and clear contributions per repo | High |
| Design director or creative lead | Judge design craft and process rigor | Ability to summarize your process in 60 seconds | Prominent case studies that foreground research, decisions, and outcomes | High |
| Accessibility officer or inclusion lead | Verify accessibility expertise and outcomes | Evidence of accessible deliverables in each case | Add accessibility audit artifacts, remediation stories, and WCAG references | High |
| Recruiter or talent sourcer | Screen quickly for keywords and seniority | Response rate to outreach | SEO-friendly headline, role keywords, and a concise executive summary | Medium |
| Mid-career professional considering mentorship or coaching | Decide whether to work with you as a mentor | Sign-up or request for session | Showcase mentorship case studies, outcomes, and a clear engagement offer | Medium |
| Product manager at a mission-driven org | Assess strategic thinking and stakeholder influence | Invite to strategy workshop | Provide strategy-focused cases with problem framing, trade-offs, and business metrics | Medium |
| Open-source project maintainers and collaborators | Evaluate fit for contribution and leadership | Acceptance of a first PR or invite to collaborate | Highlight OSS contributions, reproducible examples, and a roadmap of intended contributions | Medium |
| Hiring committee or cross-functional panel | Align on evidence across domains | Committee consensus to progress candidate | Create a one-page synthesis that maps skills to competency rubric | Low |
| Clients or executives seeking consultancy | Decide to engage on a scoped project | Conversion to paid pilot | Clear services list, case studies with ROI, and a simple engagement path | Low |
| Peer network and thought leaders | Share work that establishes thought leadership | Citations, speaking invites, or shares | Publish short essays or interactive artifacts that reveal your philosophy in practice | Low |

### Quick notes on using this list
- **Design for the highest priority users first** to maximize hiring outcomes and signal strength in Ethical AI and accessibility.
- **Surface evidence differently** for each user: visual story-driven cases for design leads, code and artifacts for engineers, outcome syntheses for managers and committees.
- **Make a single canonical narrative** that each user can consume at different depth levels: 30 second, 3 minute, and 15 minute pathways.

# LinkedIn Hashtag Strategy for Portfolio Posts

## Research Summary (November 2025)

LinkedIn hashtags remain effective in 2025 when combined with keyword optimization and high-quality content. The platform's algorithm uses hashtags as "strategic amplifiers" within its keyword-driven system.

### Key Changes in 2025
- LinkedIn removed hashtag following functionality
- Hashtags no longer appear in profile displays
- Hashtags removed from dropdown search bar
- Shift towards SEO integration over pure hashtag discovery

### Best Practices (2025)
- **Optimal number**: 3-5 hashtags per post
- **Strategy**: Mix 1-2 broad hashtags (reach) with 2-3 niche hashtags (relevance)
- **Accessibility**: Use PascalCase for multi-word hashtags (e.g., #ProductManagement) to support screen readers
- **Placement**: LinkedIn recommends hashtags at the end of posts

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Research before using**: Check hashtag follower counts on LinkedIn search to confirm current popularity
2. **Mix tiers**: Always combine broad reach hashtags with niche relevance hashtags
3. **Stay relevant**: Only use hashtags that genuinely apply to your content
4. **Test and iterate**: Monitor which hashtag combinations drive engagement
5. **Accessibility matters**: Use PascalCase for all multi-word hashtags

## Hashtags to Avoid

- Generic catch-alls without specific audience (#Success, #Inspiration)
- Overused without differentiation (#Leadership alone without niche pairing)
- Too niche/low traffic as primary tags (unless paired with broader tags)
- Trending hashtags unrelated to content (gaming the algorithm backfires)

# In Defense of Stability: Why WCAG's Legal Entrenchment Serves Accessibility

*A Counterfactual Response to Claims of Regulatory Ossification*

---

The narrative that WCAG's legal codification has "stalled" accessibility innovation rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of how civil rights protections function. Legal standards do not exist to facilitate perpetual technical refinement—they exist to provide predictable, enforceable protections for vulnerable populations. The entrenchment of WCAG 2.x in regulatory frameworks represents not a failure of the system but its proper functioning. Before rushing to embrace untested alternatives like APCA, the accessibility community should carefully consider what would be lost if the stable foundation of WCAG were undermined.

## The Value of Legal Certainty

Legal certainty is a core principle of jurisprudence and the rule of law, mandating that legal norms must be clear, precise, stable, and foreseeable in their application to enable individuals, businesses, and governments to anticipate the consequences of their conduct and make informed decisions without undue risk of arbitrary enforcement. This principle enables predictability in legal systems, ensuring that laws provide accessible standards whose content and implications are sufficiently determinate to guide behavior and constrain discretionary power.

The criticism that WCAG has been "frozen" in regulatory frameworks treats stability as a bug rather than a feature. For the 1.3 billion people worldwide living with disabilities, consistent enforcement of known standards offers more practical protection than the promise of theoretically superior algorithms that remain years from adoption. The WCAG 2.1 document itself acknowledges this reality, noting that it is "designed to meet the needs of those who need a stable, referenceable technical standard."

Consider the alternative: a regulatory environment where accessibility standards shift with each technical advancement. Organizations would face constant uncertainty about compliance requirements. Enforcement would become arbitrary, as regulators and courts struggled to determine which version of which algorithm applied at any given time. The disability community would trade enforceable rights for perpetual promises of improvement.

## APCA's Unresolved Complexity

Critics of WCAG's simplicity often fail to acknowledge that complexity has costs—costs that fall disproportionately on smaller organizations and less experienced designers. The APCA system, whatever its technical merits, introduces substantial implementation challenges that the current framework avoids.

As accessibility expert Eric Eggert has observed, "Any color combination with APCA needs to be checked for both font-size and weight, making requirements documents and design systems more complicated." The APCA approach requires designers to compare their chosen fonts to a Helvetica-based reference lookup table—a process Eggert describes as "error-prone" because "this comparison seems to be done on a visual level." This introduces subjectivity into what should be an objective compliance determination.

The APCA algorithm itself remains in flux. Eggert notes that "the APCA algorithm is changed occasionally" which means designers "might use a color that is not sufficient by a later version." For organizations building long-term design systems, this instability creates genuine risk. WCAG 2.x, for all its limitations, offers a stable target.

Furthermore, the APCA's sliding scale approach—while more nuanced—eliminates the clarity that pass/fail criteria provide. When accessibility is legally mandated, clear thresholds matter. Courts and regulators need unambiguous standards to enforce. A gradient system that offers "Bronze, Silver, Gold" conformance levels may provide better guidance for committed accessibility practitioners, but it complicates legal enforcement for the vast majority of cases.

Even Andrew Somers, APCA's creator, acknowledges the complexity concern, noting that he is "already widely criticized (at least by the troll army) that APCA is too complex" and that the team is "looking for ways to simplify, not add complexity." When the algorithm's own developer admits to ongoing simplification efforts, it seems premature to fault regulators for not adopting it.

## The WCAG Framework's Broader Strengths

The focus on contrast algorithms obscures a crucial point: WCAG is far more than a contrast specification. As Somers himself has acknowledged, "There's a lot in WCAG 2 that's very good and very important for accessibility—just not the contrast." The guidelines address keyboard accessibility, text alternatives, navigability, timing, seizure prevention, and dozens of other critical success criteria. Even if WCAG 2.x's contrast algorithm were entirely replaced, the framework's value would remain.

WCAG 2.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation on October 5, 2023, demonstrating that the standard continues to evolve within its established structure. The update added nine new success criteria addressing drag-and-drop alternatives, focus appearance, and authentication accessibility—areas that affect real users every day. The standards body has shown itself capable of incorporating new requirements while maintaining backwards compatibility and legal clarity.

The W3C's approach ensures that content conforming to WCAG 2.2 also conforms to WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.0. This backwards compatibility is not an accident—it is a deliberate design choice that enables gradual improvement without disrupting existing compliance efforts. Organizations that invested in WCAG 2.0 conformance did not suddenly become non-compliant when 2.1 or 2.2 emerged.

## The Real Source of Non-Compliance

The oft-cited statistic that 86 percent of websites fail WCAG contrast requirements deserves scrutiny. Does this figure indict the standard, or does it indict implementation? WebAIM's methodology, which automatically scans home pages, captures a snapshot of real-world compliance—and reveals that the problem is not overly stringent requirements but insufficient commitment to meeting any requirements.

If WCAG 2.x contrast requirements were truly impossible to satisfy, we would expect near-universal non-compliance. Instead, the 14 percent of sites that do comply demonstrate that conformance is achievable. The issue is not that the standard is technically flawed; it is that many organizations have not prioritized accessibility.

The argument that designers ignore WCAG because its contrast algorithm "causes problems" conflates two distinct phenomena: designers who genuinely try to comply but find edge cases frustrating, and designers who simply do not prioritize accessibility. Replacing WCAG with APCA would not change the behavior of the latter group. As one accessibility practitioner noted, "WCAG is the floor, not the ceiling"—organizations that treat minimum conformance as maximum effort will continue to do so regardless of which algorithm is legally mandated.

## The Risk of Premature Adoption

The W3C's Visual Contrast of Text Subgroup wiki contains an advisory notice stating that materials there are "not to be considered 'normative' and it is not a part of W3C standards unless specifically stated." Additionally, the published WCAG 3 working draft as of late 2024 does not include the contrast requirements or the method for APCA. This is not bureaucratic obstruction—it is responsible standards development.

<!-- ⚠️ VERIFY: The exact language about Visual Contrast subgroup materials should be confirmed against the current W3C wiki page at https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Visual_Contrast_of_Text_Subgroup -->

APCA's proponents often cite peer reviews validating its technical superiority. But as discussions in the W3C's repositories note, the Contrast Subgroup has been asked to ensure that "the research and resulting algorithm requires extensive peer review from other researchers in color contrast before adoption." This is not an unreasonable demand. Standards that will be legally mandated for millions of organizations and that protect the rights of billions of users deserve rigorous validation.

The approximately four-year timeline that Somers estimates for WCAG 3.0's adoption is not evidence of regulatory failure—it is evidence of a standards process taking appropriate care. The European Accessibility Act, the ADA, Section 508, and numerous international regulations all rely on WCAG. Hasty adoption of an incompletely validated alternative would affect legal frameworks across dozens of jurisdictions.

## Compliance Culture as Minimum Viable Protection

The critique of "compliance culture" in accessibility—the tendency to treat legal requirements as ceilings rather than floors—contains a kernel of truth but draws the wrong conclusion. The solution to organizations doing the minimum is not to replace clear minimums with fuzzy gradients.

Legal mandates establish baselines below which conduct becomes actionable. The existence of a clear WCAG 2.x contrast threshold means that a person with low vision denied access to a non-conforming website has grounds for a complaint. If that threshold were replaced with a sliding scale where various conformance levels offer "flexibility," the legal case becomes murkier.

The business case for accessibility extends beyond compliance, as W3C's documentation extensively argues. Organizations genuinely committed to accessibility will exceed WCAG requirements regardless of which algorithm underlies them. But for the many organizations that are not so committed, clear legal requirements provide the only meaningful pressure for improvement.

## The Path Forward Within Existing Frameworks

Nothing prevents organizations from using APCA today as a supplementary design tool while maintaining WCAG 2.x conformance for legal purposes. This dual approach—which practitioners already recommend—captures the benefits of both systems: legal clarity from WCAG, design refinement from APCA.

The Bridge PCA tool, designed to be "backwards compatible with WCAG 2" while using "APCA technology," demonstrates that the dichotomy between old and new is false. Organizations can adopt perceptually accurate contrast calculations internally while satisfying legal requirements externally. This is not a compromise—it is a sensible transition strategy.

If APCA proves its worth through widespread voluntary adoption, its eventual incorporation into WCAG 3.0 will be more robust and its legal adoption less disruptive. Rushing to replace a functioning legal framework with an immature alternative serves neither accessibility nor the disability community.

## Conclusion

The entrenchment of WCAG in legal frameworks reflects hard-won civil rights protections, not regulatory capture by an inferior standard. Legal certainty, implementation simplicity, and enforceable thresholds serve the disability community in ways that technically superior but unstable alternatives cannot.

The criticisms of WCAG 2.x contrast are technically valid but practically overstated. The standard works well for the most common use cases—light backgrounds with dark text—and provides enforceable protections where none previously existed. Its limitations in edge cases like dark mode do not invalidate its value in ordinary cases.

APCA represents promising research that may eventually improve accessibility outcomes. But promising research is not the same as a mature, validated standard ready for legal adoption. The W3C's cautious approach to WCAG 3.0 development reflects appropriate stewardship of a standard that affects billions of people.

The disability community has waited decades for enforceable digital accessibility protections. Those protections should not be destabilized in pursuit of technical perfection. The path forward lies in strengthening enforcement of existing standards while allowing next-generation approaches to mature through proper validation. That is not regulatory ossification—it is responsible governance of civil rights protections.

# Personal Brand: The Integrative Ethicist of Design and Technology

I am a systems-minded integrator who bridges disciplines—visual design, product strategy, accessibility, and ethics—with philosophical rigor and emotional clarity. I thrive at the edge of research and application, where ideas meet accountability. My presence challenges assumptions, elevates standards, and centers the marginalized.

I'm known for:

* Disruptive clarity: I cut through vagueness with well-reasoned insights that often challenge the status quo.
* Cross-domain synthesis: I connect dots across design, development, cartography, and accessibility to create inclusive, mission-aligned solutions.
* Moral leadership: I advocate fiercely for first-class citizenship for people with disabilities and push for ethical defaults in emerging tech like AI.
* Unflinching accountability: I own my ideas, learn from missteps, and invite others to challenge me—without ego.
* Quiet influence: Though my intensity may intimidate, my openness and generosity make me a trusted resource and thought leader.

My ideal environment is one where:

* Research meets real-world impact.
* Risky, high-accountability problems are welcomed.
* I'm surrounded by people smarter than me, who care deeply about their craft.
* Marginalized voices are centered—not just included.

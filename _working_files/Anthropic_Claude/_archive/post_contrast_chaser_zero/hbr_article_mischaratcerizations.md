* "How One Developer's Color Problem Sparked a Government-Wide Accessibility Revolution" is a too sensational and strong. Instead of "Revolution", it is more accurate to say something closer to wide-spread change. The concern with "Revolution" is that it comes with an expected optic of obvious to an outsider change when the reality is that an outsider wouldn't see it if they were to glance at the government.
* "top-tier government cartographer" is too strong. "senior government cartographer" is closer to the gist that I am a high performing cartographer. It may help you to know that what differentiates me from lower tier cartographers is the breadth of my expertise that goes beyond cartography to include but not be limited to development, UX/UI, HCD, accessibility, design, and art direction.
* "1000 by 1000" or similar language was used as a ballpark during the interview. It would be more accurate to state "100 by 100" which of course means 10000 variations which is still far more than the current 40 to 50 choices in modern day contrast chaser.
* In "With no marketing budget, no official backing, and infrastructure cobbled together from various government systems—some possibly unaware their resources were being used—the tool spread entirely through word of mouth among "passionate" and "artistic" government designers.",  the part "some possibly unaware their resources were being used",  may be taken by some in the audience of doing something illegal. All systems are being used in accordance with expectations by system owners. The nuance is that these system owners may be pleasantly surprised to see how the openness of their systems have enabled something like Contrast Chaser.
* "Leadership wants all the benefits but none of the responsibility," is correct. However, it's inclusion in the article should be treated carefully. In its current form, the quote implies that leadership is malevolent when the nuance is that they too are restricted by resources and organizational constraints that limit their ability to officially take on responsibility for the project.
* "presentations about it overflow with attendees" is too strong. Use something similar to "presentations about it are filled with attendees"
* "inboxes fill with urgent requests" is too strong. Use something similar to "inboxes light up with urgent requests". I want to avoid inference about numbers that "inboxes fill with urgent requests" suffers from.
* "don't want to be involved because it doesn't have the baggage of official support." while correct paints an overly negative picture of management out of context. Avoid the use of the quote.
* "While clichéd, Contrast Chaser proves this truth: one frustrated cartographer with a color problem has transformed how thousands of government designers approach accessibility, creating ripple effects that may ultimately reshape global accessibility standards." has the section "thousands of government designers". It is better to say "numerous government designers ". Again, similar to a previous comment, we must avoid inferring numbers. While "thousands" is not as exact as 3200, it still indicates 1000 to 9999.
* "protection without control" is vague and hard to understand at the end of the article.  Right now it comes off as letting folks run wild with no accountability. If the gist was to protect culture without dictating it, it is not clear with the current phrasing.
* "Overflow attendance at presentations" is too strong. Try something closer to "Strong attendance" or "full attendance".

# Case Study: Contrast Chaser Zero

## Identifying the Problem

Contrast Chaser was a product born out of good intention and personal frustration.

It was sometime in 2014 when my office started an ad hoc effort to improve the accessibility of our largely visual products.

I was a senior cartographer who specialized in map based visualizations and was seen as a corporate resource on visual design for my peers. Having been used to the branding and style expectations of my office, accessibility with its objective measurements and judgements of inclusive contrast essentially invalidated most if not all of what was considered "good design" at the time.

Having struggled with the soft expectations of what met an art director's approval, I partly enjoyed this circumstance but knew that the existing practice of creating a design, testing it for contrast, and then adjusting colors was far too slow to meet my production output needs. Experiencing this, I identified **the problem** that Contrast Chaser needed to solve:

**"Accessible Contrast Testing is too slow."**

## From Problem to MVP

**Ideating** about the needs of a visualization producer like myself, the two things I needed to do to produce visually accessible data visualizations are:

1. Measure Contrast
2. Find a new color that meets contrast if I don't have enough.

Conducting initial **user research** by interviewing several colleagues who were running into the same problem, several of my personal needs and preferences were validated while also highlighting additional needs and preferences that visualization producers like myself had. All of these included but are not limited to:

1. Preference for using a familiar interface
2. Understand why their existing color does not pass.

Because this was a passion project that had no immediate goal of competing in a marketplace, **planning** out the product's roadmap, with its clear market goals and milestones, could be skipped with more attention on **prototyping**—the creation of prototypes was the most fun part of the project as I am a researcher at heart.

Several prototypes were created which focused on different aspects of the **minimum viable product (MVP)**.

1. User experience and interface prototype (Grey Getter).
2. Color metadata visualization (Color Blind Color Palette Trends)
3. Color contrast edge case identification (Accessible Color Scatterplot)

### Grey Getter: User Experience and Interface Prototype

Figure 1 Image Here

Figure 1. Grey Getter is a proof of concept where Contrast Chaser validated its initial user experience with a user interface that allowed the input of any color, options for contrast, and a data visualization that updates based on user choices.

### Color Blind Color Schemes: Color Metadata Visualization Prototype

Figure 2 Image Here

Figure 2. Color Blind Color Schemes was created to explore what aspect of color could be used to explain why certain colors succeed in accommodating persons with vision disability. Hue, lightness, and saturation (circle size) produce an informative visualization.

### Color Contrast Trends: Edge Case Identification Prototype

Figure 3 Image Here

Figure 3. Color Contrast Trends researches color patterns specific to certain contrast ratios. These patterns are important because they represent design limits that the Contrast Chaser application should handle for users, leaving them satisfied with their results.

Combining the results from each prototype, Contrast Chaser's **MVP** was formed.

Figure 4. Contrast Chaser Zero is the minimal viable product of Contrast Chaser released to organization users in support of new accessibility guidance. Contrast Chaser Zero combines the validated user experience of Grey Getter with the research findings of Colorblind Color Schemes, and Color Contrast Trends to create an application that measures contrast success while providing users intuitive solutions to keep moving forward on their designs.

This MVP was then offered to the workforce as a usable beta for our ad hoc accessibility efforts with the goal of offering something immediately usable by the workforce but with the expectation that users test the MVP's concept, and provide feedback through **user validation**.

While all feedback was recorded for later action and represented a diverse array of **pain points** with the product, the number one thing that user after user brought up was:

**"It's too hard to input colors into the application!"**

While the solution was straightforward in the form of adding an eyedropper feature (similar to what most design tools do), there was a lack of browser support. While waiting for browser support to catch up, user training specific to common workflows was provided to offer near term relief.

## MVP Becomes Official

Eventually, browser support did catch up and in the span of a couple hours—thanks to anticipatory **ideation**, **research**, **planning**, and **prototyping** of the eyedropper feature—the feature was launched on a Friday afternoon, and ready for users immediately. This **iteration** demonstrated the value of maintaining a prepared **product roadmap**. I came in on Monday to a lot of excitement and thanks!

Typical steps following the graduation of an MVP into an official product like. . .

1. **Sourcing**
2. **Costing**
3. **Commercialization**

. . .did not occur as it does in private industry (with the intention to scale and create revenue) but instead these steps were reinterpreted for the government in terms of:

1. Identifying maintenance barriers
2. Working with the confines of a taxpayer funded information technology environment
3. Generating continuing mission impact.

## Outcomes and Product Leadership

Today Contrast Chaser enjoys wide usage across the government—a clear signal of **product-market fit**—enabling an increasing number of visualization producers to create inclusive media. **Adoption metrics** continue to grow as more teams discover the tool's value.

Additionally, I lead an independent Contrast Chaser team that exercises full **product ownership**. This includes **stakeholder management** across multiple organizations, maintaining the **product roadmap**, and **feature prioritization** based on user feedback. The team enjoys the confidence of management in autonomously managing the product, having earned good will through the initial development of Contrast Chaser and our success in advocating for our users. We continue to show other organizations by example what the best of our organization has to offer in terms of talent.

## Summary

Contrast Chaser Zero followed a structured product development lifecycle:

1. **Problem Definition** — Identified that accessible contrast testing was too slow
2. **User Research** — Validated needs through colleague interviews
3. **Prototyping** — Built focused prototypes to test specific hypotheses
4. **MVP Launch** — Released a minimum viable product to gather real user feedback
5. **Iteration** — Improved the product based on pain points and browser capabilities
6. **Scale** — Achieved product-market fit and established ongoing product ownership

This approach—grounded in industry best practices—enabled a passion project to become an established tool serving accessibility needs across the government.
